\section{Searching for the Smallest Oscillation Angle: $\theta_{13}$ Experiments} 
\label{sec:theta13}
In contrast to the  Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix in quark mixing, where all three mixing angles are very small~\cite{PDG14}, the mixing angles in the neutrino mixing matrix appear to be large: $\theta_{23}$, measured by the atmospheric~\cite{Kajita} and long-baseline accelerator~\cite{Feldman} neutrino experiments, is about $45^\circ$, and $\theta_{12}$, measured by the solar neutrino experiments and KamLAND, is about $33^\circ$. It was therefore natural to expect the third mixing angle, $\theta_{13}$, to be of similar magnitude.

The cleanest way to measure $\theta_{13}$ is through kilometer-baseline reactor neutrino oscillation experiments. The reactor $\bar\nu_e$ oscillation at $\sim$km is dominated by the $\theta_{13}$ terms. Unlike accelerator neutrino experiments, the reactor measurements are independent of the CP-violating phase and $\theta_{23}$, and only slightly dependent on the neutrino mass hierarchy and matter effect. A high precision measurement can therefore be achieved.

In 1990s, two first-generation kilometer-baseline reactor experiments, CHOOZ~\cite{Chooz} and PALO VERDE~\cite{Paloverde} were constructed to measure $\theta_{13}$. 
The CHOOZ detector was built at a distance of $\sim$1050 m from the two reactors of the CHOOZ power plant of \'{E}lectricite\'{d}e France in the Ardennes region of France. It took data from April 1997 until July 1998. 
The PALO VERDE detector was built at distances of 750, 890 and 890 m from the three reactors of the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station in the Arizona desert of the United States. It took data between October 1998 and July 2000. 
Surprisingly, neither experiment was able to observe the $\bar\nu_e$ deficit caused by $\theta_{13}$ oscillation. 
As a result, only an upper limit of $\sin^22\theta_{13} < 0.15$ at 90\% C.L. was obtained.

The null results from CHOOZ and PALO VERDE, combined with the measured values of $\theta_{23}$ and $\theta_{12}$, motivated many phenomenological speculations of neutrino mixing patterns such as bimaximal and tribimaximal mixing~\cite{Harrison,Altarelli}. 
In most of these theories, $\theta_{13}$ is either zero or very small. 
A direct consequence of a vanishing $\theta_{13}$ is that the CP violation in the leptonic sector, even if large, can never be observed in the neutrino oscillation experiments. 
The importance of knowing the precise value of $\theta_{13}$ provoked a series of world-wide second-generation kilometer-baseline reactor experiments in the 21st century, including Double Chooz~\cite{DChooz} in France, RENO~\cite{Reno} in Korea and Daya Bay~\cite{Dayabay} in China, to push the sensitivity to $\theta_{13}$ to below $10^\circ$. 
Table~\ref{tab:theta13} summarizes some of the key parameters of the five aforementioned experiments.

A common technology used in both the first and second generation experiments is the gadolinium-loaded liquid scintillator as $\bar\nu_{e}$ detection target. Gd has a high thermal neutron capture cross section. With $\sim$0.1\% gadolinium loading, the neutron capture time is reduced to $\sim$28 microseconds from $\sim$200 microseconds for the un-loaded scintillator (as is used in KamLAND.) Furthermore, Gd deexcitation after the capture releases an 8-MeV gamma-ray cascade, which gives a delayed signal well above natural radioactivity (In contrast, neutron capture on proton releases a single 2.2-MeV $\gamma$.) The accidental coincidence background is therefore drastically reduced.

The most significant improvement of the second-generation experiments over the previous ones is the addition of near detectors at baselines of a few hundred meters. 
As discussed in Section II, the uncertainty in predicting the reactor antineutrino flux is relatively large (2--5\%.) 
This flux uncertainty, however, can be largely canceled from a relative measurement between near and far detectors. 
The Double Chooz experiment expands CHOOZ by adding a near detector at a distance of $\sim$400 m. 
The installation of the near detector, however, was delayed due to civil construction. 
Double Chooz started taking data in May 2011 with only a far detector, and used the Bugey4~\cite{Bugey4} measurement to normalize the reactor flux. 
The RENO experiment was built near the six reactors of the Yonggwang nuclear power plant in Korea. 
The two identical detectors were located at 290 and 1380 m, respectively, from the center of reactor array. 
RENO started taking data in August 2011. 
The Daya Bay experiment was built near the six reactors of the Daya Bay nuclear power plant in southern China. 
Daya Bay had eight identical antineutrino detectors (ADs). 
Two ADs were placed at $\sim$360 m from the two  Daya Bay reactor cores. 
Two ADs were placed at $\sim$500 m from the four Ling Ao reactor cores. 
And four ADs were placed at a far site $\sim$1580 m away from the 6-reactor complex. 
This modular detector design further allows Daya Bay to largely remove the correlated detector systematics. 
Daya Bay started taking data in December 2011.

Compared to the first-generation experiments, the second-generation experiments have much larger statistics by utilizing higher power reactors and larger detectors. Among them, Daya Bay has the largest reactor power (17.4 GW$_{th}$) and target mass (80 tons at the far site,) as shown in Table~\ref{tab:theta13}. 
The underground sites are much deeper to allow better shielding from cosmogenic background, in particular compared to the case of PALO VERDE. 
Better chemical recipes of the gadolinium-loaded liquid scintillator also improves the overall detector performance and long term stability.

The second-generation reactor experiments were a huge success. 
In 2012, all three experiments, Double Chooz, Daya Bay and RENO, reported clear evidences of $\bar\nu_{e}$ disappearance at $\sim$kilometer baselines with only a few month's running~\cite{DChooz,Reno,Dayabay}. 
In particular, Daya Bay excluded $\theta_{13}=0$ by 5.2 standard deviation with 55 days of data~\cite{Dayabay}. 
The precision of the $\theta_{13}$ measurement improves quickly with more data.
Fig.~\ref{fig:dayabay} (left) from Daya Bay, with the data collected through November 2013~\cite{Zhang-Neutrino14}, shows the ratio of the detected to expected no-oscillation $\bar\nu_{e}$ signals at the 8 detectors located in the three experimental halls, as a function of effective baseline.
The signal rate at the far site shows a clear $\sim$6\% deficit with respect to the near sites, and fits nicely to the theoretical oscillation curve (in red) with $\sin^22\theta_{13} = 0.084 \pm 0.005$. 
Although last known, the precision in $\theta_{13}$ measurement (6\%) is now the best among all three mixing angles.

Similar to KamLAND, the ratio of the detected $\bar\nu_{e}$ events to no-oscillation expectation at Daya Bay is plotted in Fig.~\ref{fig:dayabay} (right) as a function of $L/E_{\nu}$. 
The combined data from the three experimental halls show a near-complete cycle of the expected periodic oscillation feature. 
The smaller amplitude and shorter wavelength of the oscillation, compared to the case of KamLAND, indicate the different oscillation component driven by $\theta_{13}$ and $\Delta{m}^2_{31}$. 
The best-fit frequency of the oscillation yields $|\Delta{m}^2_{31}| = 2.47^{+0.11}_{-0.10} \times 10^{-3}$ eV$^2$ (assuming normal mass hierarchy), which is in good agreement and of comparable precision with the results from atmospheric and long-baseline accelerator neutrino experiments. 

The longstanding puzzle of the value of $\theta_{13}$ is now successfully resolved.
The relatively large value of $\theta_{13}$ opens the gateway for future experiments to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy and measure the CP violating phase in the leptonic sector.
