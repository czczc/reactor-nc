\label{sec:prospects}

Over the past $\sim$60 years, nuclear reactors have proven to be one of the most powerful tools to study neutrino oscillations, the quantum-mechanical phenomenon that requires extensions to the Standard Model. Experiments at a few kilometers and at a few hundred kilometers from the reactor cores produced the most convincing proofs of neutrino oscillations, by observing in the $L/E$ domain the oscillatory behavior of reactor $\bar\nu_e$'s during their propagations. Several key parameters governing the neutrino mixing, $\theta_{12}$, $\theta_{13}$, $\Delta{m}^2_{21}$ and $|\Delta{m}^2_{31}|$, were also precisely measured by reactor experiments. With the upcoming next-generation reactor neutrino oscillation experiments, we expect to uncover more facts about neutrinos, which may hold the key to our deeper understanding of the fundamental physics and the universe.
